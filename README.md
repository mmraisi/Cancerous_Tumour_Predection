# Cancerous_Tumour_Predection
predict whether a person’s tumour is cancerous in order to decide whether surgery is necessary or not.

The “cancer.csv” dataset deals with cancer patients. A tumour is a set of cells that
have grown in a specific part of body. Tumours can be classified as being either
cancerous or non-cancerous based on various factors. Cancerous tumours continue
to grow uncontrollably and spread to different parts of the body and eventually to
the bloodstream. At this stage, they begin interfering with body functions that can
lead to death (example heart attack from clogged arteries). The reason it is important
to classify tumours correctly is because generally it is expensive and risky to try to
remove all tumours. In this problem, we want to predict whether a person’s tumour
is cancerous in order to decide whether surgery is necessary or not.
